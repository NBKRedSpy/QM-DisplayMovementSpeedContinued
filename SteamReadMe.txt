and change "Comma" [url=https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html]with a Unity Keycode of your choice (scroll down to the Properties section)[/url].

[h1]Text Issue[/h1]

There is a known issue where the text might be slightly covered or discolored. This is due to a change in how 0.8.5 renders units and may be addressed in future game updates.
