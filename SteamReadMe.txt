[h1]Display Enemy Movement Speed - Continued...[/h1]


[h1]Functionality[/h1]

For the people constantly right clicking on enemies to not get owned by 3AP melee goons.
Shows the amount of action points an enemy can spend. If the enemy is melee only, an 'M' will also be displayed.

Toggleable with the comma key, rebindable with a config file.

[h1]Continued Notes[/h1]

This is a continuation of GitHub user [url=https://github.com/jamsge]jamsge's[/url] fantastic mod of the same name.
If the original author comes back, this mod will be removed in favor of their mod listing.

[h1]Alternative Version[/h1]

Cryano has made versions of this mod with improved graphics and additional information.

Personally I run this mod and their Hover version together.

[h2]Config[/h2]

To rebind the comma key toggle, go to:
[i]%UserProfile%\AppData\LocalLow\Magnum Scriptum Ltd\Quasimorph_ModConfigs\QM_DisplayMovementSpeedContinued\config.json[/i]
and change "Comma" [url=https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/KeyCode.html]with a Unity Keycode of your choice (scroll down to the Properties section)[/url].

[h1]Text Issue[/h1]

There is a known issue where the text might be slightly covered or discolored. This is due to a change in how 0.8.5 renders units and may be addressed in future game updates.
